        "In order to find the best feature which will reduce the randomness after a split, we can compare the randomness before and after the split for every feature. In the end we choose the feature which will provide the highest reduction in randomness. Formally randomness in data is known as 'Entropy' and difference between the 'Entropy' before and after split is known as 'Information Gain'. Since in case of decision tree we may have multiple branches, information gain formula can be written as,\n",

        "In case of gini impurity, we pick a random data point in our dataset. Then randomly classify it according to the class distribution in the dataset. So it becomes very important to know the accuracy of this random classification. Gini impurity gives us the probability of incorrect classification. We’ll determine the quality of the split by weighting the impurity of each branch by how many elements it has. Resulting value is called as 'Gini Gain' or 'Gini Index'. This is what’s used to pick the best split in a decision tree. Higher the Gini Gain, better the split\n",
